[WARNING] bootstrap class path is not set in conjunction with -source 8
  not setting the bootstrap class path may lead to class files that cannot run on JDK 8
    --release 8 is recommended instead of -source 8 -target 1.8 because it sets the bootstrap class path automatically
[WARNING] source value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
[WARNING] target value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
[WARNING] To suppress warnings about obsolete options, use -Xlint:-options.
[INFO] Annotation processing is enabled because one or more processors were found
  on the class path. A future release of javac may disable annotation processing
  unless at least one processor is specified by name (-processor), or a search
  path is specified (--processor-path, --processor-module-path), or annotation
  processing is enabled explicitly (-proc:only, -proc:full).
  Use -Xlint:-options to suppress this message.
  Use -proc:none to disable annotation processing.
